		</ul>

		<p>The Policy is a set of measures aimed at preventing the legalization of income obtained illegally (through participation in criminal activities, shadow economy) to prevent or at least reduce the possible risks that the Company will become involved in this type of activity. Globally, the Policy is a powerful interstate mechanism. It is not only preventing the operation of financial "laundries" but also increasing barriers that will prevent the support of terrorists and the creation of weapons capable of mass harm to the population.</p>

		KYC is a procedure requiring financial institutions to find out who their customers are. Legally compliant institutions, acting solely within the legal framework, are instructed not to conduct transactions unless the persons involved are identified.
